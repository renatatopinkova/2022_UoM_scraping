```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```


## Load libraries
```{r}
library(rvest)
library(dplyr)
```


## Read the webpage into R
In this exercise, we are working with https://quotes.toscrape.com
```{r}


```


## Your turn!

### 1. Extract the texts of quotes
```{r}


```


### 2. Extract the authors of the quotes
Note: The number of authors should correspond to the number of quotes
```{r}


```


### 3. Bind the quotes and their authors into a dataframe
Note: Think about functions you know from base R, dplyr, or other packages you use.
```{r}

```

### 4. Bonus: Extract links to authors' pages
Note: You will need `html_attr()` to do it. 
```{r}


```
